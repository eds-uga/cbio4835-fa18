If you are building on an existing model, you should cite that model and give a brief description here, or possibly in the Introduction.\n",

If you developed a new model you can also describe the content of that model in the first section of Results (you would describe the code and software though in Methods). For example, if you developed an ODE model using SciPy, you would briefly mention and cite SciPy and ODE's in the Methods section, but present the actual model--species and reactions--in the Results section.\n",
